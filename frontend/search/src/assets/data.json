The complex web of factors that influence the prevalence of Lyme disease illustrates to students the many ways in which climate change affects how humans interact with the ecosystems they inhabit. Because the transmission of Lyme disease is as related to human activity (e.g. hiking, hunting, etc.) as it is to changing tick populations, this story offers an opportunity for students to empower themselves and their communities to take concrete actions toward preventing the spread of Lyme disease. It is important, however, for students to understand that climate change is just one piece of the complex \u201cecosystem model\u201d that affects ticks. The idea that neither we nor the researchers investigating this phenomenon have all the answers should be consistent throughout.</p><p>Although the causes are complex and there are countless factors at play, the rise of Lyme disease in Maine is well-documented in both academic and journalistic literature.
